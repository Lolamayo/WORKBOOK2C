                       The TouchMe by Playtronica: Measures intensity of touch between people and turns it into sound. Simple and intuitive interface for exploring tactility. 
                       I discovered this company who sell a product which is basically exactly what I am hoping to produce. HOWEVER, my take away from the product was that it is somewhat awkward that both parties need to be holding the touch pads at all times to produce sound. It certainly removes an aspect of romantic wonder.
                      <br><br>
                      This got me thinking about <b>wearables,</b> which I believe could make the product more subtle and usable.
                      <br>
                      For example, a scarf sewn with conductive thread through it could be attached in one place to a power source - for example by a banana clip, or attached to a wire. 
                      Then, the scarf could be touched in any place by a person and the electrical capacity would result in a different sound playing depending on the distance of the spot touched from the power source.
                      Thus, two people interacting with the scarf together could make their own 'Love Song', as could a baby, two small children, a parent and child... etc. 
                      Additionally, a conductive ring could be soldered to a live wire, and worn by a person so that when they make contact with another person the electrical capacity produces sounds. 
                      The threshold can be lowered or otherwise altered so that a lower, or no sound is produced by the wearer alone, but contact with another party produces different sounds.
                      An additional application could be that an individual produces sound with their own ring, and sends the 'Love Song' to their lover when they are apart.
