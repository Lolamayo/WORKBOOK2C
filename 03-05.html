                        Artist Lauren Lee McCarthy is interested in social relationships in automation, surveillance, and algorithmic living. 
                        McCarthy is the creator of p5.js, an open-source Javascript coding framework prioritizing inclusivity access and education for groups who have not traditionally had access to technology.
                        Of her own work, McCarthy said "I am captivated by how we are taught to interact with algorithms, and how this shapes our personal interaction. 
                        Central to my work is a critique of the simultaneous technological and social systems we are building around ourselves. 
                        What are the rules, what happens when we introduce glitches?" 
                        In 'Lauren', the artist has 24/7 observational access to a home for whom she acts as a smart home helper, controlling all aspects of the home. 
                        Her ability to anticipate needs makes the relationship more effective than a human-machine relationship, but not quite human-human.
                        <Br><br>
                        Another work is a series of <b>'Wearable Devices'</b> that use sensors to condition the behavior of the wearer to expected social behaviors. 
                        <br>
                        The <b>'Body Contact Training Suit'</b> requires the wearer to maintain frequent body contact with another person in order to hear them, encouraging conscious, focused and intimate interactions. 
                        If the wearer goes for a while without touching their conversation partner, static noise plays through headphones sewn into the hood. 
                        A capacitance sensing circuit measures skin to skin contact via a metal bracelet sewn into the sleeve.
