                        Chindougu 珍道具ちんどうぐ is made up of two words. Chin 珍ちん means "curious" or "strange." Dougu 道具どうぐ means "tool" or "device."

                <b>1. CHINDOGU MUST BE (ALMOST) COMPLETELY USELESS</b>
                This is the utmost tenet. If your invention is a real help and you use it all the time, it's not chindogu. Try selling it to the public because it could be worth millions. Too bad it has no soul.
                <br><b>2. CHINDOGU MUST EXIST</b>
                Chindogu have to be made. If you design the invention on paper and don't make it, it doesn't qualify. It's a piece of paper with a bad invention on it. Bring the invention into the physical world so humankind can experience how truly almost useless it is.
                <br><b>3. CHINDOGU REPRESENT FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND ACTION</b>
                Chindogu are free to be what they need to be. Normal devices are designed for efficiency, ease of use, and utility.
                <br><b>4. CHINDOGU'S USELESSNESS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY ALL</b>
                If you create a device that is only recognized as useless by people with certain knowledge sets (doctors, mechanics, biologists, etc.) then it is not chindogu.
                For example, if you make a useless invention intended to help with space shuttle operations, it would take a rocket scientist to distinguish it from useful space tools. Normal people must be able to recognize the uselessness immediately.
                <br><b>5. CHINDOGU ARE NOT FOR SALE</b>
                If you accept money for your invention, it ceases to be chindogu. You have violated its spirit.
                <br><b>6. HUMOR MUST NOT BE THE SOLE REASON FOR MAKING CHINDOGU</b>
                Any humor derived from chindogu is a side effect. The invention must earnestly try and solve a problem. The roundabout and unconventional way it solves the problem is the source of the humor.
                <br><b>7. CHINDOGU ARE NOT PROPAGANDA</b> 
                They are made to be used, even though they are (almost) useless. They are not, in and of themselves, a statement for any cause or philosophy.
                <br><b>8. CHINDOGU ARE NEVER TABOO</b>
                Chindogu inventions cannot be made to enact or represent cheap sexual innuendo, vulgar humor, or sick jokes that disrespect living things.
                <br><b>9. CHINDOGU CANNOT BE PATENTED</b>
                The invention must remain in the public domain. It must be free to use, re-create, and distribute. It cannot be copyrighted or owned.
                <br><b>10. CHINDOGU ARE WITHOUT PREJUDICE</b>
                Chindogu view all human beings as equal. Therefore, they can't favor a race, religion, age group, gender, or class.
