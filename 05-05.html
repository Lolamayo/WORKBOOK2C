                        <p>Data Garden was founded by Joe Patitucci and Alex Tyson as a zero waste record label in 2011. 
                            Initially a passion project, it has evolved into a leader in data sonification and generative 
                            design. Patitucci’s interest in generative music, algorithmic and ambient music composition 
                            along with Alex Tyson’s interest in early studies in plant consciousness led the group to 
                            create its first plant music installation. engineer and developer, Sam Cusumano, who created 
                            a system that translated micro fluctuations in conductivity on the surface of a leaf into MIDI 
                            that could control hardware and software synthesizers. This MIDI data was then translated into 
                            harmonious music through Joe Patitucci’s algorithmic composition and sound design. The result 
                            was Data Garden Quartet, a plant music performance with four tropical plants playing music in 
                            harmony.
                            In 2019, Data Garden developed PlantWave, an intuitive consumer product that would open-up 
                            plant music to a whole new audience for just $299. The PlantWave device is connected to a 
                            plant with adhesive electrodes which measures biological changes within the plant, graphs 
                            them as waves and translates it into pitch. The PlantWave app connects to the device via 
                            bluetooth, allowing users to play the 'plant music' through their phone, headphones, etc.</p>

                <h3>Synesthesia</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I am interested in senses, and the role they play in memory, and the magic that comes from mixing them up... 
                  The idea of plants making music is so wonderful, even though in actuality the plants are not themselves producing sound, and the sound is not individual of the plants and their activity. 
                In fact, it is just the electric capacity between the two organic beings.</p>
